# ML Math Notes

Math foundations for Machine Learning, focused on **intuition, visualization, and practical understanding** rather than heavy mathematical proofs.

Topics covered include:
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Probability & Statistics
- Optimization

This repository is built progressively with notebooks and visual explanations that directly connect mathematical concepts to how machine learning models work.

## Structure & Progress

### Book 1 — Vectors (Data Representation)
- Vector intuition
- Data points as vectors
- Vector magnitude and distance
- ML view: samples and features in vector space

---

### Book 2 — Matrices & Dot Product (Prediction Mechanism)
- Matrix shapes and intuition
- Matrix–vector multiplication
- Dot product
- ML view: linear model predictions as weighted sums

---

### Book 3 — Derivatives (Learning Signal)
- Derivative as rate of change
- Slope visualization
- Sensitivity of loss
- ML view: how the model knows it is wrong

---

### Book 4 — Gradients & Gradient Descent (Optimization Basics)
- Partial derivatives
- Gradient as a vector of slopes
- Direction of steepest descent
- Numerical gradient computation
- ML view: updating all weights simultaneously to reduce loss

---

### Book 5 — Probability & Statistics (Data Behavior)
- Mean, variance, and standard deviation
- Data distribution and spread
- Noise intuition
- ML view: why data is noisy and why loss cannot be zero

---

### Book 6 — Loss & Cost Functions (Training Objective)
- Error vs loss vs cost
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Effect of outliers on loss
- Classification loss intuition (log loss)
- ML view: training as minimizing average loss over a dataset

---

## Learning Philosophy

- Math is treated as a **tool**, not the goal
- Emphasis on **ML relevance and intuition**
- Concepts are implemented and visualized using NumPy
- Heavy theory and formal proofs are intentionally avoided

This repository serves as a foundation for:
- Machine Learning from scratch
- Understanding model training and optimization
- Building strong intuition before using ML libraries
